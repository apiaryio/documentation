We have a step by step guide on [Continuous Deployment of a Node.js app from Bitbucket to nodejitsu](http://blog.codeship.com/how-to-deploy-a-node-js-app-from-bitbucket-to-nodejitsu/). Though we are using BitBucket in the tutorial it is easy to get this running with GitHub as your source code provider.

If you are interested in other languages and hosting providers please check out the [Deployment Academy](http://blog.codeship.com/category/deployment-academy) on our blog.
