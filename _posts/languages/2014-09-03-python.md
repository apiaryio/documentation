We use **virtualenv** to manage python environments for you. We currently support Python `2.7.6`. Version `3.4.0` of Python is installed as well and available via the `python3` binary.

## Dependencies
You can use pip to install any dependencies, for example

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Python 3
If your project requires version 3 of Python, you can include the following snippet in your _Setup Steps_ to create a virtual environment based on the included `python3` binary.

```shell
virtualenv -p `which python3` ~/.python3_venv
source ~/.python3_venv/bin/activate
```
