We use RVM to manage different Ruby versions. We set <strong>2.1.2</strong> as the default version. Currently we do not load the Ruby version from your Gemfile. You can always change the Ruby version by running:

~~~shell
rvm use RUBY_VERSION_YOU_WANT_TO_USE
~~~

The following Ruby versions are preinstalled

{% ruby_versions %}

## Setting the Ruby version through a .ruby-version file
You can also use your .ruby-version file on the Codeship. The .ruby-version file lives in the project root and its content is just your Ruby version, for example: ```2.0.0-p195```. You can just read the ruby version to use from that file:

~~~shell
rvm use $(cat .ruby-version) --install
~~~

One use case is that you can change your Ruby version for different branches.

## Bundler
Bundler is preinstalled for all Ruby versions.

## Supported Test Frameworks
We support all Ruby based test frameworks from RSpec, Cucumber to Minitest or others.

## Run with bundle exec
Make sure to run your commands with ```bundle exec``` (e.g. ```bundle exec rspec```) so all commands you run are executed with the versions of the ruby gems you configured in your Gemfile.lock

## Capybara
Capybara is supported out of the box with the selenium-webdriver , capybara-webkit or the poltergeist driver for phantomjs.
